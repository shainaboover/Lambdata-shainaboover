- What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews? That is, what is
  something you pay attention to when you review code, and that you appreciate
  when others do the same for your code?

When other people review my code, I get to see how a fresh set of eyes interprets what I've written. Sometimes, things that seem straightforward to me can be looked at in a different way, and it's helpful to see where those differences can cause confusion. When I review code, I get to learn from the way other people approach problems which broadens my own problem solving skills.


- We have an awful lot of computers here, and it gets pretty confusing with
  slightly different things running on all of them. How could containers help us
  improve this situation?

Containers package code with all it's dependencies, meaning everything the code needs to run properly is already there for you. This ensures that different operating systems or environments will not affect the ability of the code to run, making it easy to share code with other people.
